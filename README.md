# Portfolio

This is my portfolio/cv website.
It's written using the [Yew](https://yew.rs) framework for Rust.
Visit https://portfolio.paelias.xyz to see the website in action.

## Dependancies

This website needs Rust, Cargo, and [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/).
To run the website locally, use
```bash
trunk serve
```
and visit `http://localhost:8080`. Use
```bash
trunk build
```
to generate a static site located in the `dist` directory.
